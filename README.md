# Online-Election-System
<ul>
  <li>This project aims to make voting process easily. In my project voting and 
counting is done with the help of computer so it saves time. There will 
be no invalid votes. It will avoid error in counting votes. It will make 
election process easy. </li>
  <li>In the existing system there is compulsory need of physical presence. So 
sometimes we have to travel long distance and for voting we have to 
wait a long time in queue to vote.
</li>
  <li>In this project voters can register themselves easily. They can login by 
their userid and password. After that they can vote. They can vote only 
once. So there will be no duplicate votes. Voter will be able to vote only 
after admin approve the details of voter. </li>
  <li>Admin can login with their username and password. They are able to add 
election,add candidate,view voters,approve voter details,view 
result,view voting statistics. </li>
